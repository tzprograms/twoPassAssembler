# twoPassAssembler
implementation of a two pass assembler to convert assembly code to machine code 
2Pass Assembler
This is a 2Pass Assembler project designed to convert assembly language code into machine code in two passes.

Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for assembling assembly language code into machine code. It follows a two-pass approach to efficiently handle symbol resolution and generate the final machine code.

Features
Two-Pass Approach: The assembler utilizes a two-pass algorithm to effectively resolve symbols and generate machine code.
Symbol Resolution: Handles symbols defined in the assembly code, resolving them in the first pass and substituting them with appropriate memory addresses in the second pass.
Error Handling: Provides robust error handling mechanisms to detect syntax errors, undefined symbols, or other issues in the assembly code.
Modular Design: The project is organized into modular components for ease of understanding, maintenance, and future enhancements.
Optimized Output: Generates optimized machine code output, adhering to the specifications of the target architecture.
Usage
Input: Prepare your assembly language code in a file with the appropriate extension (e.g., .asm).
Run Assembler: Execute the assembler program, providing the path to the input file as an argument.
bash
Copy code
$ ./assembler.py input.asm
Output: Upon successful assembly, the program will generate the corresponding machine code output.
Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:

Python: The assembler is written in Python and requires Python interpreter (3.x) to run.
Additional Libraries: None
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Navigate to the project directory.
Place your assembly language code in the appropriate file.
Run the assembler with your assembly file as input.
Example
Suppose you have the following assembly language code in a file named example.asm:

assembly
Copy code
; Example Assembly Language Code
START:
    LOAD A, 100
    ADD A, B
    STORE A, RESULT
    HALT

    ORIG 100
B:  DATA 200
RESULT: DATA 0
Running the assembler:

bash
Copy code
$ ./assembler.py example.asm
This will generate the machine code output.
